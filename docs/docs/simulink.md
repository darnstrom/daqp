## Setting up the problem

In Simulink, an s-function block can be used to solve a quadratic program. The s-function needs to link to the compiled c-code called "daqp_sfunc". To compile the c-code, the following matlab-script can be used in the terminal:

```matlab
make_sfunc()
```

_Note_: Please make sure to have a C-compiler installed on your system and linked in matlab. This can be checked by running ``mex -setup`` in the terminal:

After the c-code has been compiled, a new file called ``daqp_sfunc.mexw64`` (windows) or ``daqp_sfunc.mexa64`` (linux, mac) should be found.

The corresponding S-function block has the following inputs:
| Inputs | Description | Size | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| $H$ | The Hessian matrix of the quadratic objective function | [$n$ x $n$] |
| $f$ | The linear part of the objective function | [$n$ x 1]
| $A$ | The matrix of linear constraints | [$m_g$ x $n$]
| $b_l$ | The lower bound of the linear constraints | [$m$ x 1]
| $b_u$ | The upper bound of the linear constraints | [$m$ x 1]
| sense | The type of the constraints | [$m$ x 1]

_Note_: When $b_u$ and $b_l$ have more elements than the number of rows in $A$, the first elements in $b_u$ and $b_l$ are interpreted as simple bounds. 

The following parameters are used to set up the problem and need to be set in the mask of the s-function block:

| Parameters | Description | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| maxIter | Maximum number of iterations | 1 |

The block has the following outputs:

| Outputs | Description | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $x$ | The optimal solution | [$n$ x 1] |
| $\lambda$ | The optimal Lagrange multipliers | [$m$ x 1] |
| $f_{val}$ | The optimal value of the objective function | 1 |
| exitflag | The exit flag of the solver | 1 |
| iter | The number of iterations used by the solver | 1 |
